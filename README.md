## üß™ Wine Quality Prediction App

This Gradio-based web application predicts wine quality (score 3‚Äì9) using physicochemical properties of wine samples. It also displays the probability distribution across quality classes, if supported by the model.

---

### üöÄ Features

- Predict wine quality (integer values from 3 to 9)
- Display class probabilities for each quality score
- PCA-based dimensionality reduction
- Scaled input features for consistent model performance
- Interactive Gradio interface

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas joblib gradio scikit-learn
  ```

### üß¨ Model Development Workflow (from `code.ipynb`)


Typical steps might include:
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality reduction using `PCA`
- Model training (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Saving model and preprocessing artifacts with `joblib`

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Ensure all files (`app.py`, `best_model.pkl`, `preprocessing_artifacts.pkl`) are in the same directory.
2. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open the local Gradio URL in your browser.
